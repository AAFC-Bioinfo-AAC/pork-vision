The program required at least 40 GB to run on the 2024 dataset. With default memory allocated to 4 CPUs, it runs out of memory.

With 12 CPUS on gpsc7 using the a100 partition.
40GB of memory was used and runtime was 90 minutes with 2024 dataset (803 images)
This was with (1,1) kernels in marbling muscle extraction and particle analysis set to 60.
With 20,20 kernel and partcile analysis set to 5 this added about an hour runtime to 150 minutes.
