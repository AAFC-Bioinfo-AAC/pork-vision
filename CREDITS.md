# Credits

This project exists thanks to the work of many people. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions below.

## Student bioinformaticians

- Sean Hill (Jan. - Aug. 2025): designed the overall pipeline architecture, re-implemented the core codebase, managed version control using GitHub, and co-authored the project documentation. Trained models and developed modules for preprocessing, orientation, marbling, colouring, measurement, and post-processing. Integrated Fiji macro-based automation for color grading and marbling detection and implemented the Python-to-Fiji interface using pyimagej to handle headless macro execution.
- Maaz Ali (Jan. - Apr. 2025): designed the overall pipeline architecture, re-implemented the core codebase, managed version control using GitHub, and co-authored the project documentation. Trained models and developed modules for preprocessing, orientation, marbling, colouring, measurement, and post-processing. Additionally, retrained the fat segmentation model and trained a new color detection model.
- Tarek Ibrahim (Jan. - Apr. 2025): Assisted with initial code refactoring.

## Bioinformaticians

- Arun Kommadath: coordinated project activities, performed code testing, reviewed documentation, and provided overall supervision and guidance.
- Edward Yakubovich (Apr. 2024 - Dec. 2024): trained new models using YOLO and SAM, and modified the code to extract muscle and fat measurements from a more diverse set of images.
- Fatima Davelouis (Oct. 2023 - Feb. 2024): developed an initial version of the image analysis code to annotate a subset of images using a pre-trained U-Net model, combined with geometry-based analysis to extract muscle and fat measurements.

## Research scientists

- Manuel Juarez: conceptualised the project and provided domain-specific expertise in meat science and grading standards, and advised on heuristic refinement.
- Bethany Uttaro (retired): developed ImageJ macros based on domain-specific expertise in meat science and grading standards.

## Research technicians

- Rhona Thacker: managed image data, manually annotated images, applied ImageJ macros, reviewed annotated images and provided feedback for heuristic refinement.
- Lacey Hudson: manually annotated images, applied ImageJ macros, reviewed annotated images and provided feedback for heuristic refinement.
- Sophie Zawadski (retired): managed image data, manually annotated images and developed ImageJ macros.
