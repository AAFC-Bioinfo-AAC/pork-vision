The AI model requires quite a bit of memory to run.
For every 100 images it is recommended you request 16GB of memory.
So for 200 images request 32 GB and so on.
Running on SIP_Primal dataset (255 images) required nearly 36 GB of memory and
the runtime was around 25 mins.
Running on SIP2024 dataset (800 images) required nearly 85 GB of memory
and the runtime was 70 minutes.
